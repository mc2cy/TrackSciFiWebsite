		<strong id="doctor">Doctor Who</strong>

		<div id="doctor_info" >
		<p> Doctor Who is a British science-ficiton TV series which basically talks about a "Doctor" who is a timelord and travels through time and space in his blue British police box called the Tardis. Every episode the Doctor travels to a different space in time and he encounters a variety of foes which he tries to stop from invading civilizations. Most of the time he travels with a companion of which he changes whenever he regenerates. </p>

		  	<p>The Time War apparently destroyed almost every Time Lord and nearly wiped out the Daleks. The Ninth Doctor was left with the belief that he was partially responsible for that terrible death toll, so its no wonder he was a harsh and at times melancholy soul.</p>
		  	<p>Rose Tyler helped him recover from the Time War and showed him the best of humanity. During his travels with her he could be surprisingly severe, showing no regret when Cassandra apparently died and intent on destroying a Dalek that Rose wanted to save. In the end, however, the shop assistant from the Powell Estate brought out the best of "the last of the Time Lords". During his final adventure with her, he was given a stark choice – was he a killer or a coward? Rejecting the cold, murderous option he felt he had once been forced to take, he now replied "Coward. Any day."" Fantastic!</p>
		  	<p>The Ninth Doctor damaged his own body when he drew out the time vortex from Rose Tyler. This sacrifice proved to be his final act and after a brief farewell, he regenerate...</p>

		  	<p>The Tenth Doctor was a charismatic mixture of apparent opposites… He could show extraordinary kindness and sensitivity, but he himself admitted he was a man who gave no second chances. As Donna Noble pointed out to him, "I think sometimes you need somebody to stop you."</p>
		  	<p>But by and large the Tenth Doctor was a happy traveller who found wonder in everything from quirky little words to a rampaging werewolf. He roamed time and space with Rose Tyler, Mickey Smith, Martha Jones and Donna Noble and all of them showed him tremendous loyalty. No wonder Sarah Jane declared, "You've got the biggest family on Earth!"</p>
		  	<p>When he knew his regeneration was imminent he visited many of the individuals who had shared his adventures. His penultimate trip was to the Powell Estate where he briefly chatted to Rose Tyler, shortly before they were due to meet "properly" for the first time, prior to their journeys together. With the help of the Ood, he then made it back to the TARDIS, began his final voyage and uttered the words, "I don't want to go! Some would claim he always says that ...</p>

		  	<p>He can turn in a moment from being interested in the largest of things to being fascinated by the tiniest of things. But his excitement sometimes results in him tripping over himself and walking into things. He enjoys anything that's different and interesting, and as always he has a powerful sense of right and wrong and a determination to do what's right. He gets on well with children. He prefers to call Amy 'Pond'. His dress sense might be a bit... odd. But he knows that bowties are cool.</p>
